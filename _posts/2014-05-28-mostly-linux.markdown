<p>I will be writing a lot of posts about Operating Systems and different kinds of Applicaitons. Mostley it would be on GNU/Linux Platforms. Mac OS X could actully work at some cases as it runs a Unix like Kernel called Darwin based on the BSD operating system</p>

### For those of you running Windows OS. Please stop.

<p>I am not a fan of Microsft Windows OS and never have been.</p>


## Awesome Linux Distros
	
	* Arch Linux: a Very Fast, Stable and custmizable Linux Distro. Its a rolling release distro which means you would always be running the latest version
	* Debian: High stability and performance. made with totally Free Software. and a lot of the popular Linux Distros are based on Debian.

	* Fedora: Its one of the most famous linux distros. owned by RedHat inc. Very Stable and powerfull. Runs on Supercomputers and its the distro of choice for the creater of the Linux Kernel Linus Torvalds.
