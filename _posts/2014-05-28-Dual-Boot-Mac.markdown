<p>Those who has a Mac computers find it hard to boot other Operating System into thier computers specially if you don't have a DVD Drive. What if you want to run a second OS like Kali Linux for PenTesting or maybe to use both OS's.</p>

<p>Well, The process isn't that diffecult and it was tested on many Mac models. Head over to http://refit.sourceforge.net/ and download the latest Mac Image. and then double click on the rEFIt.mpkg package. and follow the instructions. Restart the computer and there you go. Now you have a nice Boot Menu.</p>

* Keep in mind that some installations required more than one restart for the menu to show up. So don't worry. *

<p>Now head over to your favorit Linux Distro download page and download it. Get a USB flash drive and using one of the USB flash tools like UnetBootin flush the image to the USB flash drive. and insert it in your Mac. Restart.</p>

<p>If you had any trouble with the process or have a better method please let me know through the comments bellow or through email at hamadeh.basel@gmail.com</p>
