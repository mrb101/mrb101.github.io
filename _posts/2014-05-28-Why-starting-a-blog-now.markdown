> Communication: The imparting or exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other medium.<br />

*"Communication" www.oxforddictionaries.com. Oxford University, 2014.*
*Web. 28 May 2014.*

<p>In the last seven months I did not have an internet connection nor a cellphone. My interaction with both of them was on a weekly basis. I thought to myself in the begning that its okay, But for how long would I be able to stay without those two main communcation tools in the digital age we live in today. The answer later was obvious. It fells a lot better. I was able to enjoy my life in each and every aspect of it.</p>

<p>Advanced communicatoin technologies are amazing and very important and I love those technologies. Though I thought that I controll those technologies. And in my mind it was only a tool for a mean. Suddnely comes the relization of the opsite. Its true that I use the technology. But I have put myself in the position where it controlls me.</p>

### Made me think a lot.

<p>Living in a simple place, Very small, With a limited people to comunicate with and no communcation tool but that Satallite phone which hardly anyone uses unless its an emergency had a set of effects on me along with the enviroment ofcourse which had its own effects. The Idea of someone leaving the house without his Cellphone today seems impossible. Everybody is expecting a phone call. While 15 years ago Cellphones were not that available. What is it that changed?</p>

### Why a static blog now ?

<p>I decided to start a blog as I have came to a point where I am furstrated with all those social networks all over the place. To get to a point we have to communicate and the more tools we have the more complicated and monopolized they become. Privacy Issues, Security, Owner ship, time consuming, Different settings, Too many passwords, and a lot more issues. But what concerns me the most is the fact that we have almost reached a point where communication through those technologies will end "real-life" face to face communication.</p>

<p>The solution in my case is the ultimate and proven excelent method. a Blog. accompanied by my eMail. Here I will share a little of my thoughts and a lot of Technology related topics.</p>
